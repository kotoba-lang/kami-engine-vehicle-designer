(ns vdesign.hydrogen
  "Per-interval hydrogen consumption and cartridge depletion on the FCEV
  energy-flow plane — the link between the DC-bus plane's fuel-cell output
  (`vdesign.dc-bus/power-split` → :intervals :fc-kw) and the replaceable
  Mg/MgH2 cartridge (`vdesign.cartridge/size-cartridge`).

  Boundary advanced: `:controlled-hydrogen-reactor` + `:replaceable-mg-or-mgh2-cartridge`
  on the vehicle energy-flow plane (system-scope.edn architecture vector).
  Before this namespace, the repo could size a cartridge from a range figure
  and split power in time, but could NOT answer \"after this drive cycle,
  how much H2 (and MgH2) has the cartridge delivered, and when does it run
  out?\" — a demonstrated downstream block for any reactor-control or
  cartridge-swap contract.

  The contract is pure bookkeeping with one physical conversion:

    per interval:  m-h2 = E-elec / (eta-fc · LHV-H2)      (LHV, energy basis)
    per interval:  m-MgH2 = m-h2 / w-h2(MgH2)             (exact desorption stoichiometry)
    cartridge:     remaining = store − Σ m-h2, floored at 0

  Provenance and unmeasured quantities:
    - `:fc-elec-eff` is REQUIRED from the caller and echoed in :provenance —
      no default is applied here, because an efficiency is an operating-point
      claim, not a constant. (`vdesign.powertrain/tech` :fc-elec-eff 0.53 is
      the workspace's declared production-technology figure; a caller may
      pass it, and then the provenance trail records that choice.)
    - LHV of H2 is the shared physics constant `vdesign.powertrain/LHV-H2-J`
      (single provenance point, re-exported below). Not re-declared.
    - w-h2(MgH2) is the exact stoichiometric mass fraction from the IUPAC
      2021 atomic weights in `vdesign.cartridge/molar-masses-g-per-mol` —
      identical arithmetic to the cartridge namespace, not a copy of it.
    - UNMEASURED and NOT modeled: operating-point dependence of eta-fc
      (polarization, BoP parasitics — see kami-engine-echem's rom-fc),
      desorption kinetics / heat of desorption / plateau pressure (the
      reactor is not simulated), minimum H2 recirculation/purge flows, and
      start-up/shutdown transients. Every result carries :unmeasured so a
      consumer cannot read the flat-efficiency bookkeeping as a measured
      reactor model.

  Refusals: non-numeric/negative fc power, non-positive dt, efficiency
  outside (0, 1], non-positive store, empty profile. A depleted cartridge
  is NOT an exception — it is a reported shortfall, mirroring
  `vdesign.dc-bus`'s deficit handling."
