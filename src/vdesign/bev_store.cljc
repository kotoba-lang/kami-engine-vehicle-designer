(ns vdesign.bev-store
  "Time-domain traction-battery state-of-charge over a signed electrical
  demand profile for a BEV — the missing dynamic half of
  `vdesign.powertrain/size-bev`, which sizes the pack only from a
  cycle-blended road-load number and never checks that the pack can
  actually carry a mission (regen included).

  Boundary advanced: `:traction-battery` (BEV store) on the vehicle
  energy-flow plane — the BEV counterpart of `vdesign.dc-bus/power-split`,
  which load-levels the FCEV's buffer battery against a fuel cell. Here
  there is no fc: the battery is the only source, so the whole signed
  demand (regen as negative) falls on the pack.

  Pure conservation-of-energy bookkeeping per interval (uniform `dt-s`):

    discharge (demand > 0): delivered = min(energy-needed, soc)
                            deficit  = energy-needed − delivered
    charge    (demand < 0): accepted  = min(energy-in, capacity − soc)
                            curtail  = energy-in − accepted
    soc' = soc + accepted − delivered

  Deficits and curtailed regen are REPORTED per interval — never clipped,
  never silently absorbed (same deficit discipline as `dc-bus`).

  Composability: `soc-for-cycle` takes a `vdesign.dutycycle/demand-profile`
  result directly (its own `:demand-kw` + `:interval-s`), so regen
  reporting, aux load, and b2w efficiency flow through exactly as the
  duty cycle reported them.

  Provenance and unmeasured quantities:
    - `:usable-capacity-kwh` is required from the caller. The tech table
      (`vdesign.powertrain/tech :bev`) records `:dod 0.90`; passing
      `(* nominal-kwh (:dod tech))` keeps that provenance with the caller.
      This contract never applies an invented usable fraction of its own.
    - Round-trip battery efficiency, DoD derating dynamics, pack aging,
      and C-rate limits are UNMEASURED and deliberately NOT modeled:
      battery flows are lossless at the bus. Every result carries
      `:unmeasured {:battery-round-trip-eff true :pack-aging true
      :crate-limits true}` so a consumer cannot read the lossless
      bookkeeping as a measured efficiency claim.

  Refusals: non-numeric demand entries, empty profile, non-positive
  `:dt-s` or `:usable-capacity-kwh`, initial soc outside [0, capacity]."
