(ns vdesign.cad
  "CAD bridge — turns a released design's `:geometry` (see
  `vdesign.design/geometry-of`) into a coarse BREP packaging envelope via
  `kotoba-lang/brep`'s parametric feature tree, then tessellates it for
  downstream CAM (`vdesign.process`) and `kotoba-lang/cad`'s artifact
  registry.

  Honest scope: this is a PACKAGING ENVELOPE — a bounding-box
  approximation of the glider volume (length × width × height) — not a
  styled body surface. `brep.feature/evaluate` currently only realizes an
  `:extrude` `:operation :new` as a fixed ±0.5-unit-square cross-section
  extruded along the given direction/distance (sketch entities are not
  yet consumed by `evaluate`; revolve/fillet/chamfer/boolean are
  documented not-yet-implemented in kotoba-lang/brep). So the cross-
  section here is realized at unit scale, then the resulting vertices are
  scaled non-uniformly to the target dimensions — a documented
  work-around for the kernel's current maturity, not a hidden one."

  toolpaths exist, or 7 (Release) once a human has actually signed off
  (`:release/design-review` earned). kotoba.cad.core's stage model has
  no per-stage completeness check of its own (it's a self-reported
  ordinal), so this only advances past Toolpath on the strongest, least-
  fakeable signal available — a recorded human approval — not merely
  because more pipeline stages ran.

  `runner-results` comes from actually running kotoba.cad.core/runner-plan
  through kotoba.cad.runner/dry-run against the real classified
  `artifacts` — genuine (if modest) evidence that the adapters have
  matching inputs, NOT a fabricated pass/fail. kotoba.cad.runner/execute!
