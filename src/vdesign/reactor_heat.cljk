(ns vdesign.reactor-heat
  "REACTOR DESORPTION-HEAT DEMAND over a landed MgH2 consumption profile —
  the smallest upstream contract that turns the `:controlled-hydrogen-
  reactor` boundary from an unmeasured flag into a VERIFIABLE thermal
  load case (system-scope.edn on origin/main).

  What existed before this contract:

    - `vdesign.hydrogen/consumption-profile` and
      `vdesign.swap-schedule/swap-schedule` both convert a fuel-cell
      electrical profile into per-interval MgH2 desorbed (`:mgh2-kg`),
      but both carry `:unmeasured {:heat-of-desorption true ...}` —
      desorbing H2 from MgH2 is ENDOTHERMIC, so every gram desorbed
      demands heat from somewhere, and NO contract on main says how
      much or whether a declared heater can supply it. A reactor/thermal
      designer (or the heater-sizing side of the
      :cartridge-dry-inert-handling cell) had nothing to compose against.

  This namespace closes that gap BY COMPOSITION + DECLARED INPUT ONLY:

      per interval:  Q[J] = mgh2[kg] · dh-J-per-kg      (desorption heat)
                     P-heat[kW] = Q / dt
      totals:        Q-total = Σ Q ; P-peak = max P-heat

  where `:dh-j-per-kg-mgh2` (positive, the enthalpy of desorption per kg
  of MgH2) is a DECLARED caller input with a non-blank provenance string
  — a measured material property this workspace does not measure. A
  silently-assumed enthalpy would bias every heater verdict, so this
  contract refuses LOUDLY (ex-info) unless both are declared. (For
  orientation only, never defaulted: published MgH2 enthalpies are
  O(10^6 J per kg) — the caller's measured figure is the ONLY number
  used.)

  Optionally the caller declares a heater capacity (`:heater-kw`, with
  provenance); each interval then gets the standard deficit discipline:
  heat demand above capacity is REPORTED as `:shortfall-kj` — never
  clipped, never silently absorbed — and `:adequate?` is true iff every
  interval's shortfall is zero. A shortfall means the declared heater
  cannot sustain the desorption rate at the declared enthalpy; the
  caller may reduce the demand, enlarge the heater, or add thermal
  storage — the contract records the arithmetic, not the remedy.

  Accepted upstream results (kind-guarded, fail-closed):
    - a `vdesign.swap-schedule/swap-schedule` result
      (`:kind :cartridge-swap-schedule`)
    - a `vdesign.hydrogen/consumption-profile` result
      (`:kind :hydrogen-consumption`)
  Both carry `:intervals [{:mgh2-kg ..} ...]` and `:provenance :dt-s`,
  which is the only upstream data consumed. A `:kind` other than these
  two is a refusal — a 700-bar tank or BEV result can never silently
  flow into a hydride-bed thermal contract.

  Explicitly unmeasured, carried on every result: the enthalpy itself
  (declared-by-caller), desorption kinetics / plateau pressure (the bed
  is treated as quasi-steady at the interval scale), bed temperature
  dynamics and heat losses to containment/ambient, regenerative heat
  from absorption during refilling, and heat recycled between cartridges.
  No Mg/MgH2, PEM, or vehicle performance constant is invented here: the
  only arithmetic is multiplication by the declared enthalpy and a unit
  conversion.

  Refusals: non-matching upstream `:kind`, non-positive/non-finite
  enthalpy, blank enthalpy provenance, a declared heater that is not a
  positive finite number, blank heater provenance, missing or
  non-positive upstream `:provenance :dt-s`, a non-numeric or negative
  `:mgh2-kg` in any interval."
