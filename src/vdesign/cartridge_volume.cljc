(ns vdesign.cartridge-volume
  "MASS↔VOLUME link for the replaceable Mg/MgH2 cartridge store — the
  smallest upstream contract that makes the PhysicsGovernor's packaging
  gate VERIFIABLE on the cartridge-fed path.

  System boundary advanced: `:replaceable-mg-or-mgh2-cartridge` +
  design-domain `:parametric-3d-model` (scripts/hermes-magnesium-systems-bots/
  system-scope.edn on origin/main).

  What existed before this contract:

    - `vdesign.cartridge-fcev/sized-store` puts the cartridge INSIDE the
      mass spiral but reports `:volume-L :unmeasured` — no volumetric
      figure for a hydride cartridge exists in this workspace — so
      `vdesign.physics/check` reports the packaging gate as
      UNVERIFIED (never a pass): a cartridge-fed design can close on
      mass/energy while its store volume is simply unknown.
    - `vdesign.cartridge-geometry` computes real volumes from
      caller dimensions but deliberately refuses to produce a MASS
      (`:mass-volume-link :unmeasured`): geometry alone cannot know how
      densely the hydride bed packs.

  This namespace closes the loop BY COMPOSITION ONLY:

      bed volume [m3] = bed mass [kg] / bed packing density [kg/m3]

  where the bed packing density is a DECLARED caller input with
  provenance — exactly the discipline `vdesign.cartridge-fcev` applies
  to the per-cartridge overhead mass. A powder bed's packing density is
  a measured material/packaging property (tapped density, compaction
  state, additive loading) that this workspace does not measure; a
  silently-assumed one would bias every packaging verdict, so this
  contract refuses LOUDLY (ex-info) unless a positive density AND a
  non-blank provenance string are both declared.

  Two volume bases, disclosed, never mixed:
    - `:volume-basis :bed-only` (no external volume declared): the
      result volume is the hydride BED volume alone — containment wall,
      heat exchange, insulation and gas headspace are NOT included, so
      the packaging verdict on this basis is a lower bound on the true
      external volume; `:containment-volume` stays :unmeasured.
    - `:volume-basis :declared-external`: the caller declares the full
      external cartridge volume (e.g. computed by
      `vdesign.cartridge-geometry` from real dimensions, wall + bore +
      bed) with provenance; that number is authoritative for packaging.
      The bed volume from the density is still computed and reported as
      a consistency check (`:bed-volume-fits-external?`): a declared
      external volume smaller than the bed it must contain is a
      physical contradiction and is REFUSED, not passed through.

  Fails closed: non-positive/non-finite density, blank provenance,
  non-positive declared external volume, declared external volume
  smaller than the bed volume it must contain, and a store whose
  `:kind` is not `:fcev-cartridge` (a 700-bar tank or BEV pack result
  can never silently flow into a hydrogen-bed contract). No Mg/MgH2,
  PEM, or vehicle performance constant is invented here: the only
  arithmetic is mass/density division and unit conversion.

  Explicitly unmeasured, carried on every result: the packing density
  itself (declared-by-caller, never measured here), powder
  void fraction / compaction dependence, desorption swelling or
  settling of the bed over cycles, gas headspace, and (on :bed-only)
  the containment volume."
