  "PhysicsGovernor — the INDEPENDENT censor of the design actor.

  Robotaxi seals AR1 behind a SafetyGovernor that can reject any
  trajectory. The mirror image here: the DesignProposer is sealed behind
  this governor, which enforces the conservation laws the proposer is
  free to ignore. It answers one question authoritatively:

      does this concept CLOSE? — i.e. is there a self-consistent curb
      mass at which the energy store sized for the required range, plus
      the glider and motor, equals that same mass, AND fits the package
      envelope, AND stays under the gross-mass limit?

  The hard part is the MASS SPIRAL: a heavier car needs a bigger store,
  which makes it heavier, which needs a bigger store… For feasible
  designs this converges to a fixed point; for over-reach (e.g. a 1500 km
  city BEV on today's cells) it DIVERGES — and divergence is the
  governor's reject signal, the design-side equivalent of an MRC.

  The whole spiral is a BOUNDED fixed-point iteration encapsulated in ONE
  node call, so — exactly like robotaxi — one graph run = one design pass,
  not an unbounded inner loop."
