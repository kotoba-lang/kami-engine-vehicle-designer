  "The design-actor invariant as executable tests:

    1. A feasible spec CLOSES (mass spiral converges) and is RELEASED.
    2. The two powertrains close to PHYSICALLY DISTINCT designs from the
       same requirements (FCEV lighter store for long range, but volume-hungry).
    3. An over-reach spec DIVERGES and is REJECTED — the proposer can NEVER
       ship a design the PhysicsGovernor hasn't closed.
    4. Energy balance scales monotonically with range (no free energy)."
