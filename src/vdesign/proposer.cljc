(ns vdesign.proposer
  "DesignProposer — the *contained concept generator*.

  This is the design-side analogue of robotaxi's sealed AR1 node: a
  capable but UNTRUSTED proposer. Given requirements it sketches a vehicle
  concept — glider mass, aero, peak power, package envelope, and an
  optimistic target curb mass. In production this is an LLM / generative
  CAD agent; here it is a deterministic heuristic so the actor runs
  offline and the closure contract is exercised end-to-end.

  CRITICAL: the proposer does NOT respect conservation laws. It will
  happily target a curb mass that no battery or tank can actually hit at
  the requested range. Every concept it emits is a *proposal*, never a
  spec — `vdesign.physics` (the PhysicsGovernor) censors it. So the
  proposer is free to be bold; the governor makes it honest."

;; energy store after cabin/cargo are carved out.
