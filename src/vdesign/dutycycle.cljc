(ns vdesign.dutycycle
  "Drive-cycle → per-interval DC-bus demand profile.

  The energy-flow plane on `origin/main` sizes stores from a single
  cycle-blended road-load number (`vphysics/road-load-J-per-km`, factor
  1.55) and the vehicle sim time-steps only the crash event
  (`vdesign.simphysics`). No contract anywhere converts a speed-vs-time
  drive cycle into the per-interval electrical demand a DC-bus
  load-leveling contract (cf. the open `agent/dc-bus-power-split`
  branch) needs as input. This namespace is that smallest upstream
  step: it produces the demand profile from first-principles forces,
  composing BY DATA ONLY — it requires nothing from any unlanded PR
  and changes no existing namespace.

  Physics per interval (uniform `:dt-s`), all SI:

    v-mid   = (v[i] + v[i+1]) / 2            ; trapezoid midpoint speed
    a       = (v[i+1] - v[i]) / dt           ; interval acceleration
    F-wheel = m·a + m·g·crr + ½·ρ·Cd·A·v-mid²
    P-mech  = F-wheel · v-mid

  - `P-mech > 0` (traction): electrical demand at the battery is
    `P-mech / :b2w-eff + :aux-w`.
  - `P-mech < 0` (deceleration): the caller-supplied fraction
    `:regen-frac` of `|P-mech|` is recovered as NEGATIVE electrical
    demand (battery charge); the rest is friction-brake heat.
    `:regen-frac` is an explicit caller input with provenance — this
    contract never assumes a recovery fraction, and the DC-bus
    load-leveling caller may equally pass 0.

  Everything is conservation-of-energy and Newton's second law on
  caller-supplied quantities; NO efficiency, drag, rolling, or
  regen constant is invented here. `:g`, `:rho-air` are the exact
  same physical constants `vphysics.core` already publishes and are
  re-declared here only to keep this namespace dependency-free.

  Fails closed: refuses non-positive dt/mass/eff, negative speeds,
  negative non-negative-quantities (crr, cd, frontal-area, aux), and
  `:regen-frac` outside [0, 1]. Negative electrical demand is REPORTED,
  never clipped or silently absorbed."
