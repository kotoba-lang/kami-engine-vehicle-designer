  "CARTRIDGE SWAP SCHEDULING over a multi-cartridge mission — the answer
  to \"after this drive cycle, how many replaceable Mg/MgH2 cartridges
  does the vehicle go through, and WHEN does each swap happen?\" on the
  vehicle energy-flow plane.

  System boundary advanced: `:replaceable-mg-or-mgh2-cartridge` +
  `:controlled-hydrogen-reactor` (scripts/hermes-magnesium-systems-bots/
  system-scope.edn on origin/main).

  What existed before this contract:

    - `vdesign.hydrogen/consumption-profile` converts a fuel-cell
      profile into per-interval H2/MgH2 draw and depletion of ONE store
      (single `:store-h2-kg`), reporting shortfall when it runs dry.
    - `vdesign.endurance/endurance` answers endurance/range for ONE
      inventory.
    - Neither represents the defining property of the cartridge from
      the system scope: it is REPLACEABLE. A mission longer than one
      cartridge can only be represented as \"one store + a big reported
      shortfall\" — the swap count and the swap timing (which determine
      the cartridge-dry-inert-handling logistics the scope lists as a
      manufacturing cell) had no contract.

  This namespace closes that gap by composition ONLY, on the landed
  plane:

    per interval:  m-h2[k]  = E[k] / (eta-fc · LHV-H2)     (same LHV basis
                                                            as the landed
                                                            consumption
                                                            contract)
    store states:  a FULL cartridge at inventory `:cartridge-h2-kg` is
                   installed at interval 0; when the active store cannot
                   cover an interval's draw, the remainder is drawn from
                   a fresh FULL cartridge installed AT THAT INTERVAL (a
                   swap), and the partially-used cartridge's remaining
                   H2 is carried as `:residual-h2-kg` (reported, never
                   discarded — an MgH2 bed's residual hydrogen is real
                   inventory, not waste).

  Deterministic policy (disclosed, not hidden):
    - `:swap-policy :draw-down` (the only policy implemented): each
      cartridge is drawn to exhaustion before the next is installed.
      One swap per depletion event; if one interval's draw exceeds
      what a fresh full cartridge covers, additional swaps happen
      WITHIN that interval (`:swaps` > 1 for that interval).
    - `:spare-cartridges` bounds how many FULL cartridges the vehicle
      actually carries beyond the initial one. When a swap needs a
      spare and none remains, the interval becomes a REPORTED
      shortfall (mirroring the deficit discipline of `vdesign.dc-bus`
      and `vdesign.hydrogen`) — never a silent success.

  What is deliberately NOT modeled (carried as :unmeasured, per the
  system rule that unknown measurements remain explicitly unmeasured):
    - desorption kinetics / heat of desorption / plateau pressure (the
      reactor is not simulated — same honesty as `vdesign.hydrogen`);
    - the TIME a swap takes and any hydrogen vented during it (swap
      transients are unmeasured; the schedule is an idealized
      instantaneous exchange);
    - whether a partially-used cartridge is recharged or replaced —
      both are representable by the caller reading `:residual-h2-kg`;
    - return-to-base vs on-vehicle-rack swap logistics.
  No Mg/MgH2, PEM, or vehicle performance constant is invented here:
  the only physics is the SAME exact LHV conversion the landed
  contracts use, re-exported from `vdesign.powertrain/LHV-H2-J`, and
  the exact stoichiometric mass fraction of H2 in MgH2 from the IUPAC
  2021 atomic weights in `vdesign.cartridge/molar-masses-g-per-mol`.

  Fails closed: non-positive `:cartridge-h2-kg`, efficiency outside
  (0, 1], non-positive dt, negative power, empty profile, non-integer
  or negative `:spare-cartridges`, or (when `:speeds-mps` is given)
  a sample count ≠ (intervals + 1), a negative speed, or a non-finite
  speed. A mission that exhausts all spares is NOT an exception — it is
  a reported shortfall with the exact interval it first occurs."
