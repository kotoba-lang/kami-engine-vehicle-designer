  "CARTRIDGE SWAP STATION CLEARANCE — the decision/audit plane for the
  :cartridge-dry-inert-handling manufacturing cell
  (scripts/hermes-magnesium-systems-bots/system-scope.edn on origin/main).

  What existed before this contract:

    - `vdesign.swap-schedule/swap-schedule` answers WHEN swaps happen and
      how much residual H2 each spent cartridge carries — but says
      nothing about whether a swap MAY be performed at a station at a
      given moment. A swap inside an MgH2 cartridge involves exposed
      hydride powder (combustible dust), residual hydrogen in the bed
      (pressure/leak hazard), and an inert-gas atmosphere that MUST be
      verified before opening any connection. The system scope lists
      `:no-autonomous-hazardous-machine-operation` as a safety boundary
      and the swap cell as an in-house manufacturing cell; neither had
      a contract.

  This namespace closes that gap as a DECISION contract, not a command
  channel. The activity→decision→effect→audit chain:

    activity    the swap events extracted from a landed
                `:cartridge-swap-schedule` result (interval + count)
    decision    per swap event: :cleared | :blocked-human-approval |
                :refused-o2-above-limit | :refused-inert-gas-unavailable |
                :refused-h2-leak-check-failed | :blocked-h2-leak-check-missing
    effect      a RECORD of the intended station effect
                (:install-full-cartridge / :remove-spent-cartridge),
                emitted ONLY for :cleared events. This is a design/
                simulation artifact — it commands nothing.
    audit       an append-only, deterministic audit log of every
                decision (cleared, blocked, or refused), carrying the
                measured inputs and provenance strings used.

  Every safety number is a DECLARED caller input with provenance, the
  same discipline `vdesign.cartridge-volume/packed-store` applies to
  bed density: an O2 interlock limit is a property of the station's
  hazard analysis and applicable code, measured/derived by the caller's
  process-safety owner — assuming one here would silently bless a swap
  under an unvetted limit. Fail-closed everywhere: missing approval,
  missing or blank provenance, missing leak-check result, O2 above the
  declared limit, or no inert gas all stop the swap LOUDLY.

  All numeric comparisons are exact declared-input arithmetic; no
  Mg/MgH2, hydrogen, or code constant is invented. Explicitly
  unmeasured, carried on every result: purge volume and purge duration
  (the station's gas ledger is a caller problem), bed temperature and
  its relation to residual-H2 release, enclosure ventilation rate,
  hydrogen sensor calibration/uncertainty, and the human approver's
  identity (the contract records THAT approval was declared, never who
  or how verified)."

  Inputs:
    schedule — a `vdesign.swap-schedule/swap-schedule` result
               (`:kind :cartridge-swap-schedule`); every interval with
               `:swaps` > 0 becomes one clearance event. A schedule
               with zero swaps returns a valid empty clearance (no
               events, nothing to approve).
