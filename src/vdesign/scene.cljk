  "Bridge from `vdesign.cad`'s tessellated packaging-envelope mesh +
  `vdesign.simphysics`'s per-tick physics trajectory into the vertex/
  index/per-frame-transform data shape `kotoba-lang/webgpu`'s
  `kami.webgpu.mesh` executor's REAL, working `upload-mesh!`/
  `render-frame!` functions already consume (ADR-2607151600).

  `:positions`/`:normals`/`:indices` in `scene-for`'s result are DIRECTLY
  the shape `kami.webgpu.mesh/upload-mesh!` destructures (`{:keys
  [positions normals indices uvs morph-target-deltas joints weights]}`,
  all but `:positions`/`:normals`/`:indices` optional) — `(select-keys
  (scene-for design) [:positions :normals :indices])` is a drop-in
  `geometry` argument for that function today. `:frames`'s per-entry
  `:transform` map (`{:translation [x y z] :rotation [rx ry rz] :scale
  [sx sy sz]}`) is DIRECTLY the shape `kami.webgpu.mesh/model-matrix`
  (and `render-frame!`'s optional trailing `transform` arg, handed
  straight to `model-matrix`) expects — one `:frames` entry per
  `vdesign.simphysics/simulate` trajectory tick.

  Two REAL, disclosed gaps close this from being a byte-for-byte
  drop-in:

  1. `vdesign.cad/envelope-mesh` produces `{:positions :indices}` only —
     no `:normals`. `kami.webgpu.mesh/upload-mesh!` requires `:normals`
     (the same length as `:positions` — it is a mandatory vertex
     attribute the shader reads, not optional like `:uvs`/skin/morph).
     `face-normals` below computes REAL per-triangle flat normals
     (cross product of each triangle's own two edges) to close this gap
     — not a placeholder/constant normal.
  2. `vdesign.cad/envelope-mesh`'s positions are in MILLIMETERS
     (`vdesign.cad/envelope-dims-mm` derives `:length-mm`/`:width-mm`/
     `:height-mm`, and `envelope-solid`'s `scale-point` scales the base
     sketch by those mm figures directly) while `vdesign.simphysics`'s
     trajectory positions are in METERS (physics_2d is unit-agnostic,
     but `vdesign.simphysics` chose meters — see that namespace's
     `vehicle-half-extents-m`). Combining raw mm vertex geometry with a
     meter-scale per-frame translation would place the mesh ~1000x too
     large relative to its own motion. `mesh->m` below converts the
     tessellated positions to meters to close this real unit mismatch.
     (An EARLIER version of this bridge also assumed `vdesign.cad`'s box
     was corner-anchored at `[0,length]x[0,width]` and shifted it to
     re-center — that assumption was WRONG, caught by
     `scene_test.cljc`: `envelope-solid` tessellates from brep.feature's
     documented `±0.5`-unit-square sketch, so the footprint is ALREADY
     centered on the local origin in X/Y (verified empirically: min-x =
     -length/2, max-x = +length/2) — only Z spans `[0,height]`
     uncentered, the extrude direction, matching the ground-plane
     convention. No XY shift is needed or applied; only the mm->m unit
     conversion.)

  Remaining, honest limitation: `kami.webgpu.mesh` itself is a `.cljs`-
  only WebGPU executor (`js/Float32Array`, real GPU device/buffer
  calls) — actually calling `upload-mesh!`/`render-frame!` needs a
  ClojureScript/browser host loading this namespace's output and
  iterating `:frames`, which this actor-only repo (no browser here)
  cannot execute. The DATA SHAPE this namespace produces is genuinely,
  verifiably compatible with that function's real input contract (see
  `scene_test.cljc`); wiring it into a live canvas is the small
  host-side step that remains, and is NOT claimed to be done here.

  Also disclosed: every frame's `:rotation` is `[0 0 0]` and `:scale` is
  `[1 1 1]` — `physics_2d`'s `Body2D` carries NO orientation/angular
  state at all (translation-only rigid body), a real property of the
  underlying solver, not something simplified away by this bridge."

  because `brep.tessellate/tessellate-solid` gives every BREP face

  range (see that namespace's `tessellate-planar-face`, which always
