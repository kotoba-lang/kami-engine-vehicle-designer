(ns vdesign.cartridge-geometry
  "Parametric, NEUTRAL-DATA-FIRST geometry of the replaceable Mg/MgH2
  cartridge (system design-domain :parametric-3d-model, system rule 7).

  The stoichiometry plane (`vdesign.cartridge`) sizes the hydride bed's
  MASS. Nothing on `origin/main` represents the cartridge's SHAPE, so a
  packaging / clash / heater-integration designer has nothing to compose
  against. This namespace is that smallest step: a pure parametric
  cross-section + volumes contract.

  What this deliberately IS and IS NOT:

    - ALL dimensions are caller-supplied with provenance. The ONLY
      constant used is π (mathematics). No Mg/MgH2 material property is
      invented: bed packing density, desorption heat, plateau pressure,
      thermal conductivity, burst pressure, and the mass↔volume link are
      all reported as :unmeasured — a caller can NEVER get a mass out of
      this namespace, only volumes and clearances.
    - NOT load-bearing structure. The result carries :load-bearing false
      (system rule 7: the cartridge is a replaceable unit).
    - NOT a kernel call. Output is neutral EDN data (polygon loops in
      metres, XY plane, cartridge axis = +Z) that any downstream CAD
      kernel can consume — vdesign.cad's BREP bridge, kami-engine-cad's
      extrude/boolean primitives, or an external STEP writer.

  Parametric consistency (fails closed, ex-info):
    - wall·2 < outer diameter (a wall ≥ outer/2 leaves no bore)
    - heater bore diameter < inner diameter (strict — equal diameter
      leaves zero bed cross-section, which is a modeling error, not a
      zero-volume corner case)
    - each port diameter < inner diameter, port-count a non-negative
      integer, port diameter required (positive) iff port-count > 0
    - :segments ≥ 3 (a polygon loop needs at least a triangle)

  Cross-section convention: centre at the origin, XY plane normal to the
  cartridge axis. Loops are CCW in XY; the heater bore loop is the hole.
  Discretisation is an explicit caller parameter (:segments) so downstream
  mesh/kernel tolerances are controlled, never hidden."
