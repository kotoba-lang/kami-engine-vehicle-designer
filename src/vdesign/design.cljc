  "VehicleDesignActor — one clean-sheet vehicle design = one supervised
  actor, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The DesignProposer is
  sealed into a single node; its concept is ALWAYS routed through the
  PhysicsGovernor before anything is emitted as a spec.

  One graph run = one design pass:

    require → propose → govern → decide ─┬─ (closes) ──▶ design-review ──▶ emit
                                         │              [interrupt-before]
                                         │               engineer signs off,
                                         │               resume ─▶ emit
                                         └─ (infeasible) ──────────────▶ emit
                                                          (rejected spec
                                                           + physics reasons)

  Mirrors robotaxi exactly: the proposer never ships a design the
  PhysicsGovernor hasn't closed; an infeasible concept falls back to a
  REJECTED spec (the design-side MRC) carrying the conservation-law
  violations as evidence; and `interrupt-before #{:design-review}` is a
  real human-in-the-loop sign-off, like robotaxi's teleop handoff.

  Run the SAME graph with {:powertrain :bev} and {:powertrain :fcev} to
  clean-sheet both architectures from one requirement set and compare."
